`{doc_as_test}` is a documentation-centric approach where documentation serves as an expected value for testing.

This crate helps implement this approach in `Rust`.

Source code is available in https://github.com/DocAsTest/doc_as_test.rust[DocAsTest/doc_as_test.rust] github repository.

== References

This approach is based on {approvals_testing}.

You can find an {approvals_testing} implementation for Rust in this Github repository: https://github.com/aleksandrpak/approvals.
